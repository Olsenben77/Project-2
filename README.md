Users are segued to next pick their individual events by date and location parameters. They are then given a final results page, highlighting their night choices. This project utilizes JavaScript and built in BootStrap functionaltiy to give the user an immersive yet seamless planning experience.

## Motivation

Our group brainstormed together and recognized the need for planning future events, especially in larger cities. Coding-wise our goal was to challenge ourselves with this project, including some difficult API's, advanced Bootstrap functionality, and a sleek UI. Our project showcases all ofthese motivations, giving us the opportunity to create something new to fit an individual's needs.
